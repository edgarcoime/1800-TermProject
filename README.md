# MEMENTO - A To-Do List

Memento is a space to organize your schedule on the browser. 

You can check the weather for upcoming tasks. Each task has its own page in case it is a task that can't be completed in one day. There are no notifications, it is a to-do list driven by the intrinsic desire of the user akin to a journal.

Feel free to access your tasks on mobile or desktop.
